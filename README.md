- **Fallback**: OMIE API for wholesale market prices

> **ℹ️ Note**: 
> - Octopus Energy España uses a GraphQL API at `https://octopusenergy.es/api/graphql/kraken`. The integration connects to this API for consumption, billing, and account data.
> - **PVPC Hourly Pricing integration is required only for market-based tariffs.** For fixed tariffs, you can configure rates manually without PVPC.
> - **Octopus Energy credentials (email/password) are required** to access consumption and billing data.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

**For market-based tariffs:**
- **⚠️ The [PVPC Hourly Pricing integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/pvpc_hourly_pricing/) must be configured first.**
  1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**
  2. Search for **"Spain electricity hourly pricing (PVPC)"** and configure it
  3. Note the sensor entity ID (default is `sensor.pvpc`)

**For all tariffs:**
- **Octopus Energy España account credentials (email and password) are required** to access consumption and billing data.

### 🎯 HACS (Recommended)

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations**
3. Click the **three dots menu → Custom repositories**
4. Add this repository URL
5. Search for **"Octopus Energy España"** and install
6. **Restart Home Assistant**

### 📁 Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/octopus_energy_es` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory

## ⚙️ Configuration

The configuration flow guides you through setting up your tariff using a category-based approach:

### Step 1: Octopus Energy Credentials (Required)

Enter your Octopus Energy España account credentials:
- **📧 Email**: Your Octopus Energy email address (required)
- **🔐 Password**: Your account password (required)

> **💡 Note**: Your account number will be automatically detected after authentication. If you have multiple accounts, you'll be able to select which one to use.

### Step 2: Pricing Model

Choose your pricing model:
- **📈 Market**: Prices vary based on the electricity market (requires PVPC sensor)
- **🔒 Fixed**: Fixed price per kWh regardless of market fluctuations

### Step 3: Time Structure (Fixed pricing only)

If you selected Fixed pricing, choose your time structure:
- **⚡ Single Rate**: Same price throughout the day
- **⏰ Time-of-Use**: Different prices for different periods (P1/P2/P3)

### Step 4: Energy Rates Configuration

**For Market pricing:**
- No rates needed (uses market prices from PVPC sensor)

**For Fixed pricing:**
- **Single Rate**: Enter your fixed rate in €/kWh
- **Time-of-Use**: Enter rates for each period:
  - **P1 Rate**: Peak period rate (€/kWh)
  - **P2 Rate**: Standard period rate (€/kWh)
  - **P3 Rate**: Valley period rate (€/kWh)
  - **Management Fee**: Monthly management fee (€/month)

**Default time-of-use periods (weekdays):**
- **P1 (Peak)**: 11:00-14:00 & 19:00-22:00
- **P2 (Standard)**: 09:00-10:00, 15:00-18:00, 23:00
- **P3 (Valley)**: 00:00-08:00
- **Weekends/Holidays**: All hours are P3 (Valley)

### Step 5: Power Rates (Optional)

Configure power (potencia) rates:
- **Power P1 Rate**: Peak period power rate (€/kW/day)
- **Power P2 Rate**: Valley period power rate (€/kW/day)

### Step 6: Solar Features (Optional)

If you have solar panels:
- **Solar Surplus Rate**: Compensation rate for surplus energy (€/kWh)

### Step 7: Discount Programs (Optional)

Configure discount hours:
- **Discount Start Hour**: Start hour for discount period (0-23)
- **Discount End Hour**: End hour for discount period (0-23)
- **Discount Percentage**: Discount percentage (0-100%)

### Step 8: PVPC Sensor Selection (Market pricing only)

If you selected Market pricing, select the PVPC Hourly Pricing sensor:
- **Default**: `sensor.pvpc` (if you haven't changed the sensor name)
- **Custom**: Enter your custom PVPC sensor entity ID if you renamed it

> **💡 Note**: Fixed pricing tariffs skip this step as they don't require market price data.

```yaml
type: custom:price-timeline-card
entity: sensor.octopus_energy_es_price
```

The sensor provides data in the required format:

- **📅 Tomorrow's Prices**: Updated daily at 14:00 CET (when Spanish market publishes)
- **📈 Consumption Data**: Updated every 15 minutes (if available)
- **🧾 Billing Data**: Updated daily

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### 🔐 Authentication Errors

**Error**: `Invalid Octopus Energy credentials` or connection errors

**Solution**: 
- Verify your email and password are correct
- Check that your account is active
- The integration uses the GraphQL API at `https://octopusenergy.es/api/graphql/kraken` (also functions at `https://api.oees-kraken.energy/v1/graphql/`)

### 💰 Prices Not Updating (Market tariffs only)

- Ensure the PVPC Hourly Pricing integration is configured and working
- Verify the PVPC sensor entity ID is correct (default: `sensor.pvpc`)
- Check that the PVPC sensor has price data available
- Check Home Assistant logs for API errors
- ⏰ Spanish market publishes tomorrow's prices at 14:00 CET - prices may not be available before that time
- **Note**: Fixed pricing tariffs don't require PVPC sensor

### 📈 Consumption Data Not Available

- Verify your Octopus Energy credentials are correct
- Check that your account number was detected correctly
- Ensure your account has consumption data available
- ⏰ Consumption data may take some time to appear after initial setup

### 🔒 Configuration Issues

- For fixed pricing, ensure all required rates are entered correctly
- Verify that time-of-use periods cover all 24 hours for weekdays
- Check that discount hours are valid (0-23) if discount program is configured
- Ensure power rates are configured if you want power cost calculations

## 📚 Dependencies

- **Octopus Energy España Account**: Required for consumption and billing data access.

## 🛡️ Error Handling

The integration includes robust error handling:
- Automatic retry logic for API failures
- Fallback to cached data when APIs are unavailable
- Fallback from PVPC sensor to OMIE API for market prices
- Graceful degradation if optional features (consumption, billing) are unavailable
